export default `Out of the silent planet is C. S. Lewis’ allegorical science fiction trilogy. Not as well known as Chronicles of Narnia and written for a much older audience. I find that this tends to be a controversial title, with most people either loving or hating it.

Still, I think Lewis is a really good writer and I find his style uniquely enjoyable. In my opinion most people should at least give this book a taste, with the understanding that it might not agree with them. I’m sure you can find somewhere to borrow a copy.

(The age rating for this series was a bit hard for me, I read it at a young age and didn’t really like it. But I came back to it as an adult and really enjoyed it. Might be suitable for some younger readers, but like wine, most probably won’t enjoy it until they’re older.)`
