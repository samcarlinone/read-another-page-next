export default `Follow a group of kids who have been kidnapped by a mysterious school that promises to train them into the world’s greatest supervillains. A series with a good cast of main characters and excellent mix of tension and humor. Some say it leans a bit too far into spy thriller tropes, but I personally enjoyed the over the top moments.

The series spans eight books (in 2020), and unfortunately is left without an end. I wouldn’t let it stop you, but those who really hate unfinished series beware.

Still one of my top kids' books. Good enough to appeal to some older readers, but not quite on the same level as the classics like *Harry Potter*.`
