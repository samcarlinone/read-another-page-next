export default `Ancillary Justice is a science fiction tale of a spaceship separated from itself.

Wait, seperated from itself? Yep. You see though the ship was controlled by a single AI, that AI also controlled a number of bodies that crewed the ship. This makes for an interesting perspective for the story.

However, this is also the reason for the 2 rating as some readers may find this unusual perspective makes the story hard to follow.`
